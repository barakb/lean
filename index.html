                <h2>Transportation</h2>
                When a company is built in functional silos, every feature have to transport a chain of teams,
                Whenever there is a bug, the feature transport again back.

            <section>
                <h2>Waiting</h2>
                Naturally each feature is waiting for the next team to finish its current task before it peeked up
                multiple time in its lifetime.

            <section>
                <h2>Overproduction</h2>
                When each feature have to be processed by every team, and the productivity of the teams is not even
                there will always
                be overproduction.

            <section>
                <h2>Defect</h2>
                QA is only started once all development is done, it is not part of the process,
                tests plan are not written at design time, quality is not built as part of the process.
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Inventory</h2>
                Lots of features on the way, started but not delivered.

                <h2>Motion</h2>
                Whenever we are creating an ad hoc team we move people unnecessarily.
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Excessive processing</h2>
                Whenever team has its own agenda, there is a risk of feature that is not needed.
                The question that we need to ask is: Who is the client? does it really need that.
